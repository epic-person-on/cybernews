## Experts Detect Multi-Layer Redirect Tactic Used to Steal Microsoft 365 Login Credentials 
 Summary: Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new phishing campaign that conceals malicious payloads by abusing link wrapping services from Proofpoint and Intermedia to bypass defenses.  "Link wrapping is designed by vendors like Proofpoint to protect users by routing all clicked URLs through a scanning service, allowing them to block known malicious destinations at the moment of click," the Cloudflare Email Security team said .  "While this is effective against known threats, attacks can still succeed if the wrapped link hasn't been flagged by the scanner at click time."  The activity, observed over the last two months, once again illustrates how threat actors find different ways to leverage legitimate features and trusted tools  to their advantage and perform malicious actions, in this case, redirecting victims to Microsoft 365 phishing pages.  It's noteworthy that the abuse of link wrapping involves the attackers gaining unauthorized access to em...

## UNC2891 Breaches ATM Network via 4G Raspberry Pi, Tries CAKETAP Rootkit for Fraud 
 Summary: The financially motivated threat actor known as UNC2891  has been observed targeting Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) infrastructure using a 4G-equipped Raspberry Pi as part of a covert attack.  The cyber-physical attack involved the adversary leveraging their physical access to install the Raspberry Pi device and have it connected directly to the same network switch as the ATM, effectively placing it within the target bank's network, Group-IB said. It's currently not known how this access was obtained.  "The Raspberry Pi was equipped with a 4G modem, allowing remote access over mobile data," security researcher Nam Le Phuong said  in a Wednesday report.   "Using the TINYSHELL backdoor, the attacker established an outbound command-and-control (C2) channel via a Dynamic DNS domain. This setup enabled continuous external access to the ATM network, completely bypassing perimeter firewalls and traditional network defenses."  UNC2891 was first documented  by Googl...

## Hackers Use Facebook Ads to Spread JSCEAL Malware via Fake Cryptocurrency Trading Apps 
 Summary: Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to an ongoing campaign that distributes fake cryptocurrency trading apps to deploy a compiled V8 JavaScript (JSC) malware called JSCEAL  that can capture data such as credentials and wallets.  The activity leverages thousands of malicious advertisements posted on Facebook in an attempt to redirect unsuspecting victims to counterfeit sites that instruct them to install the bogus apps, according to Check Point. These ads are shared either via stolen accounts or newly created ones.  "The actors separate the installer's functionality into different components and most notably move some functionality to the JavaScript files inside the infected websites," the company said  in an analysis. "A modular, multi-layered infection flow enables the attackers to adapt new tactics and payloads at every stage of the operation."   It's worth noting that some aspects of the activity were previously documented by Microsoft in April 2...

## PyPI Warns of Ongoing Phishing Campaign Using Fake Verification Emails and Lookalike Domain 
 Summary: The maintainers of the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository have issued a warning about an ongoing phishing attack that's targeting users in an attempt to redirect them to fake PyPI sites.  The attack involves sending email messages bearing the subject line "[PyPI] Email verification" that are sent from the email address noreply@pypj[.]org  (note that the domain is not " pypi[.]org ").  "This is not a security breach of PyPI itself, but rather a phishing attempt that exploits the trust users have in PyPI," Mike Fiedler, PyPI Admin, said  in a post Monday.  The email messages instruct users to follow a link to verify their email address, which leads to a replica phishing site that impersonates PyPI and is designed to harvest their credentials.  But in a clever twist, once the login information is entered on the bogus site, the request is routed to the legitimate PyPI site, effectively fooling the victims into thinking that nothing is amiss when, in r...

## Chaos RaaS Emerges After BlackSuit Takedown, Demanding $300K from U.S. Victims 
 Summary: A newly emerged ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gang called Chaos is likely made up of former members of the BlackSuit crew , as the latter's dark web infrastructure has been the subject of a law enforcement seizure.  Chaos, which sprang forth in February 2025, is the latest entrant in the ransomware landscape to conduct big-game hunting and double extortion attacks.  "Chaos RaaS actors initiated low-effort spam flooding, escalating to voice-based social engineering for access, followed by RMM tool abuse for persistent connection and legitimate file-sharing software for data exfiltration," Cisco Talos researchers Anna Bennett, James Nutland, and Chetan Raghuprasad said .  "The ransomware utilizes multi-threaded rapid selective encryption, anti-analysis techniques, and targets both local and network resources, maximizing impact while hindering detection and recovery."  It's important to note here that the ransomware group is unrelated to the Chaos ransomware ...

## Cybercriminals Use Fake Apps to Steal Data and Blackmail Users Across Asia's Mobile Networks 
 Summary: Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new, large-scale mobile malware campaign that's targeting Android and iOS platforms with fake dating, social networking, cloud storage, and car service apps to steal sensitive personal data.  The cross-platform threat has been codenamed SarangTrap by Zimperium zLabs. Users in South Korea appear to be the primary focus.  "This extensive campaign involved over 250 malicious Android applications and more than 80 malicious domains, all disguised as legitimate dating and social media applications," security researcher Rajat Goyal said .  The bogus domains, which impersonate legitimate app store listing pages, are used as a lure to trick users into installing these apps, resulting in the exfiltration of contact lists and images, all while keeping up an illusion of legitimacy.  Once installed, the Android apps also prompt the victim to enter an invitation code, after which it's validated against a command-and-control (C2) server. ...
