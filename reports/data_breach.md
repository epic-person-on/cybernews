## ⚡ Weekly Recap — SharePoint Breach, Spyware, IoT Hijacks, DPRK Fraud, Crypto Drains and More 
 Summary: Some risks don't breach the perimeter—they arrive through signed software, clean resumes, or sanctioned vendors still hiding in plain sight.  This week, the clearest threats weren't the loudest—they were the most legitimate-looking. In an environment where identity, trust, and tooling are all interlinked, the strongest attack path is often the one that looks like it belongs. Security teams are now challenged to defend systems not just from intrusions—but from trust itself being turned into a weapon.  ⚡ Threat of the Week  Microsoft SharePoint Attacks Traced to China  — The fallout from an attack spree targeting defects in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers continues to spread a week after the discovery of the zero-day exploits, with more than 400 organizations globally compromised.

## Scattered Spider Hijacks VMware ESXi to Deploy Ransomware on Critical U.S. Infrastructure 
 Summary: The notorious cybercrime group known as Scattered Spider  is targeting VMware ESXi hypervisors in attacks targeting retail, airline, and transportation sectors in North America.  "The group's core tactics have remained consistent and do not rely on software exploits. Instead, they use a proven playbook centered on phone calls to an IT help desk," Google's Mandiant team said  in an extensive analysis.  "The actors are aggressive, creative, and particularly skilled at using social engineering to bypass even mature security programs. Their attacks are not opportunistic but are precise, campaign-driven operations aimed at an organization's most critical systems and data."  Also called 0ktapus, Muddled Libra, Octo Tempest, and UNC3944, the threat actors have a history  of conducting advanced social engineering attacks to obtain initial access to victim environments and then adopting a "living-off-the-land" (LotL) approach by manipulating trusted ad...

## ⚡ Weekly Recap: SharePoint 0-Day, Chrome Exploit, macOS Spyware, NVIDIA Toolkit RCE and More 
 Summary: Even in well-secured environments, attackers are getting in—not with flashy exploits, but by quietly taking advantage of weak settings, outdated encryption, and trusted tools left unprotected.  These attacks don't depend on zero-days. They work by staying unnoticed—slipping through the cracks in what we monitor and what we assume is safe. What once looked suspicious now blends in, thanks to modular techniques and automation that copy normal behavior.  The real concern? Control isn't just being challenged—it's being quietly taken. This week's updates highlight how default settings, blurred trust boundaries, and exposed infrastructure are turning everyday systems into entry points.  ⚡ Threat of the Week  Critical SharePoint Zero-Day Actively Exploited (Patch Released Today)  — Microsoft has released fixes to address two security flaws in SharePoint Server that have come under active exploitation in the wild to breach dozens of organizations across the world.

## Critical Unpatched SharePoint Zero-Day Actively Exploited, Breaches 75+ Company Servers 
 Summary: A critical security vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server has been weaponized as part of an "active, large-scale" exploitation campaign.  The zero-day flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-53770 (CVSS score: 9.8), has been described as a variant of CVE-2025-49704  (CVSS score: 8.8), a code injection and remote code execution bug in Microsoft SharePoint Server that was addressed by the tech giant as part of its July 2025 Patch Tuesday updates.  "Deserialization of untrusted data in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint Server allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network," Microsoft said  in an advisory released on July 19, 2025.

## Newly Emerged GLOBAL GROUP RaaS Expands Operations with AI-Driven Negotiation Tools 
 Summary: Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation called GLOBAL GROUP  that has targeted a wide range of sectors in Australia, Brazil, Europe, and the United States since its emergence in early June 2025.  GLOBAL GROUP was "promoted on the Ramp4u forum by the threat actor known as '$$$,'" EclecticIQ researcher Arda Büyükkaya said . "The same actor controls the BlackLock RaaS and previously managed Mamona ransomware operations."  It's believed that GLOBAL GROUP is a rebranding of BlackLock after the latter's data leak site was defaced  by the DragonForce ransomware cartel back in March. It's worth mentioning that BlackLock in itself is a rebrand of another RaaS scheme known as Eldorado.  The financially motivated group has been found to lean heavily on initial access brokers (IABs) to deploy the ransomware by weaponizing access to vulnerable edge appliances from Cisco, Fortinet, and Palo Alto Networks. Al...

## The Unusual Suspect: Git Repos 
 Summary: While phishing and ransomware dominate headlines, another critical risk quietly persists across most enterprises: exposed Git repositories leaking sensitive data. A risk that silently creates shadow access into core systems  Git is the backbone of modern software development, hosting millions of repositories and serving thousands of organizations worldwide. Yet, amid the daily hustle of shipping code, developers may inadvertently leave behind API keys, tokens, or passwords in configuration files and code files, effectively handing attackers the keys to the kingdom.  This isn't just about poor hygiene; it's a systemic and growing supply chain risk. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, so do compliance requirements. Security frameworks like NIS2, SOC2, and ISO 27001 now demand proof that software delivery pipelines are hardened and third-party risk is controlled. The message is clear: securing your Git repositories is no longer optional, it's essential.  Below, we look at the ris...

## 5 Ways Identity-based Attacks Are Breaching Retail 
 Summary: From overprivileged admin roles to long-forgotten vendor tokens, these attackers are slipping through the cracks of trust and access. Here's how five retail breaches unfolded, and what they reveal about...  In recent months, major retailers like Adidas, The North Face, Dior, Victoria's Secret, Cartier, Marks & Spencer, and Co‑op have all been breached. These attacks weren't sophisticated malware or zero-day exploits. They were identity-driven, exploiting overprivileged access and unmonitored service accounts, and used the human layer through tactics like social engineering.  Attackers didn't need to break in. They logged in. They moved through SaaS apps unnoticed, often using real credentials and legitimate sessions.  And while most retailers didn't share all the technical details, the patterns are clear and recurring.   Here's a breakdown of the five recent high-profile breaches in retail:  1. Adidas: Exploiting third-party trust  Adidas confirmed  a data breach caused by an ...

## Manufacturing Security: Why Default Passwords Must Go 
 Summary: If you didn't hear about  Iranian hackers  breaching US water facilities, it's because they only managed to control a single pressure station serving 7,000 people. What made this attack noteworthy wasn't its scale, but how easily the hackers gained access — by simply using the manufacturer's default password "1111." This narrow escape prompted  CISA  to urge manufacturers to eliminate default credentials entirely, citing "years of evidence" that these preset passwords remain one of the most exploited weaknesses.  While we wait for manufacturers to implement better security practices, the responsibility falls on IT teams. Whether you manage critical infrastructure or a standard business network, allowing unchanged manufacturer passwords in your environment is like rolling out the red carpet for attackers. Here's what you need to know about default passwords — why they persist, their business and technical consequences, and how manufacturers can imple...

## That Network Traffic Looks Legit, But it Could be Hiding a Serious Threat 
 Summary: With nearly 80% of cyber threats now mimicking legitimate user behavior, how are top SOCs determining what's legitimate traffic and what is potentially dangerous?  Where do you turn when firewalls and endpoint detection and response (EDR) fall short at detecting the most important threats to your organization? Breaches at edge devices and VPN gateways have risen from 3% to 22%, according to Verizon's latest Data Breach Investigations report. EDR solutions are struggling to catch zero-day exploits, living-off-the-land techniques, and malware-free attacks. Nearly 80% of detected threats use malware-free techniques that mimic normal user behavior, as highlighted in CrowdStrike's 2025 Global Threat Report. The stark reality is that conventional detection methods are no longer sufficient as threat actors adapt their strategies, using clever techniques like credential theft or DLL hijacking to avoid discovery.   In response, security operations centers (SOCs) are turning to a  multi-lay...

## Leveraging Credentials As Unique Identifiers: A Pragmatic Approach To NHI Inventories 
 Summary: Identity-based attacks are on the rise. Attacks in which malicious actors assume the identity of an entity to easily gain access to resources and sensitive data have been increasing in number and frequency over the last few years. Some recent reports estimate that 83% of attacks involve compromised secrets . According to reports such as the Verizon DBIR , attackers are more commonly using stolen credentials to gain their initial foothold, rather than exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration.  Attackers are not just after human identities that they can assume, though. More commonly, they are after Non-Human Identities (NHIs), which outnumber human identities in the enterprise by at least 50 to one . Unlike humans, machines have no good way to achieve multi-factor authentication, and we, for the most part, have been relying on credentials alone, in the form of API keys, bearer tokens, and JWTs.   Traditionally, identity and access management (IAM) has been built on the idea of...
